1. Consider the following discrete equation:
<br>
y [ n ] = 1 
<br>
3 ( x [ n ] + x [ n−1 ]+ x [ n−2 ])
<br>
a. Determine the z-transform of the equation. This will give you both Y(z) and X(z).
<br>
b. Determine the transfer function H(z)
<br>
H(z) = Y(z)
<br>
X(z)
<br>
c. Use the substitution z=e j ^ω to determine the equation for the frequency response of the system, H (e j ^ω).
<br>
d. Plot the magnitude of the frequency response.
<br>
e. Plot the phase of the frequency response.
<br>
For parts (d) and (e) use Matlab functions.
<br>
2. Write below (or in your lab book) how you determine magnitude and phase “by hand”.
<br>
a. Sketch with pencil the magnitude and phase responses. Hint: use Euler identities.
<br>
b. Now, use Matlab to plot the magnitude and phase responses with the Euler identities substitutions.
<br>
c. Can you account for the differences among the plots in (1) and (2)?
