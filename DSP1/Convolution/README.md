1. Jim opens an investment certificate today on his 30th birthday. He deposits $2000 at this time
and on every birthday thereafter. In addition, he earns interest compounded annually. The
table below shoes the rate of interest per year. Write a difference equation which calculates
the amount he’ll have in his account by his 60th birthday. Write a brief computer program to
calculate this amount. Hand in your code with the answer.

2. Consider the following running average filter. Write a MATLAB program that performs the
following tasks.
where x ( k ) =sin ( 0.1 πk ) −2 cos ( 0.2 πk ) + 3 sin ( 0.3 πk ) , 0 ≤ k < N
Compute and plot the impulse response h(k) for 0 ≤ k < N where N = 50 from 1st
principles. Now, use the functions ‘filter’ and ‘conv’ to arrive at the same results
