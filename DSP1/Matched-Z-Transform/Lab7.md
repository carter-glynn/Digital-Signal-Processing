Design a 2nd order analog highpass filter from the general s-transform equation and then derive its digital equivalent using the substitution: s+a → 1−e−aT z−1. For this filter:
<br>
1) Determine the cut-off frequency.

<br>
2) Determine the passive component values.

<br>
3) Derive the transfer function H(ω).
<br>
4) Plot the frequency response of both the analog and the discrete filter on the same axes.
<br>
Do this for both magnitude and phase.
