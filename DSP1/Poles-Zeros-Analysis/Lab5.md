Consider the following z-domain equation:
H(z)= (10z^3)/(z^4-0.81)
1. Determine and plot the poles and zeros by hand.
2. Now use Matlab internal function pzplot to plot the poles and zeros.
3. Use Matlab function freqz to compute the magnitude response and the phase response
at M = 500 points assuming fs = 200 Hz.
4. Write a program to calculate the magnitude and phase responses from first principles
