In this exercise, you are to perform time-domain to frequency-domain transform of the audio file provided using an N-term DFT and MDCT. For the DFT, you can use internal Matlab functions. For the MDCT, you must create it “by hand”. After performing the transforms, you must then reconvert the audio back into time-domain data and then play it out to examine the quality of the transform for the number of terms that you used. To get acceptable quality, how many terms do you need for MDCT? How many for DFT? Comment on the appropriateness of using MDCT for audio encoding.

...To measure the difference between the original and the reconstructed signal, take the difference between the two and plot as a function of discrete time.
