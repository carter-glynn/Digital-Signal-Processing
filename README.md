<br>
Contains assignments and labs from my Digital Signal Processing courses at Conestoga College. <br>
Mostly concerns MATLAB code<br>
Emphasis on the use of the FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) as an analysis tool. Use of digital filtering in areas such as speech processing, noise cancelling, and telecommunications.
